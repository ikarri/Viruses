	<h1><u>What Is The Coronavirus?</u></h1>
	<p>What is the Coronavirus? The Coronavirus is a deadly and dangerous virus that is spreading across the world rapidly. The virus was found in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It started from wet markets and the sickness carried on to everyone else. The virus has started to spread from country to country. Currently, they are more than 17.2 Million cases around the world! And they are 671K plus deaths across the world! 10.1 Million people have recovered which is great! It is inportant to take precautions this time and be safe. This safetiness will likely prevent you from getting the virus. Covid-19 is something we should take seriously and listen and follow the guidelines that are provided by CDC. The symptoms for Covid is a fever, coughing, shortness of breath, fatigue, headaches, body aches, vomiting, and a few more. This virus is like SARS-CoV. We do not have a vaccine currently but scientists are researching and testing. This pandemic that is taking place, the cases keep on tremendously rising everyday. And many people are losing their lives and it's very sad. </p>
	<h2><u>When Is This Virus Going To End?</u></h2>
	<p>This question is going across everyone's mind everyday. We can stop this virus if we work as a team and stay home and safe. If we need to get groceries, food, and essentials, we can do that stuff online. They are ways that we can do things instead of going outside of the house. If we keep on going out without masks and don't maintain social distance, the cases and deaths will keep on increasing. We hope that we soon get a vaccine to cure everyone. So, this is the best way to STOP Covid-19. WORK TOGETHER!</p>
