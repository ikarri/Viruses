	<h1><u>What Is A Virus?</u></h1>
	<p>A virus is a submicroscopic infectious agent that replicate the living cells inside an organism. The viruses can infect all types of living forms. The virus kills use the normal cells in the body and multiplies and produce viruses. If this happens it can damage or change the cells in your body which can make you sick. The virus can attack cells in your liver, blood, and respiratory system. These cells could be killed which is very bad for your body. Few of the biggest outbreaks in history that have taken place is the Black Death, VHFs, Cholera Epidemics, Smallpox, Typhus Outbreaks, Spanish flu, HIV-AIDS Epidemic, SARS-CoV Outbreak, Swine flu, Ebola Outbreak, MERS, SARS, COVID-19, and more! They're so many pandemics that have occured and have taken away several lives.</p>
	<h2><u>How Do Pandemics Start?</u></h2>
	<p>Viruses may have formed by mobile genetic elements that are able to move between cells. They could have came from free-living organisms, and they could have exsisted before and continued to pass on. If you get the virus, the virus cannot form in your body without infecting your cells. So what the virus does is that it infects your normal cells which makes you sick. The virus spreads to person to person which can kill them. It can pass on by coughing, touching, sneezing, and other ways. It is very easy to get the virus if you have close contact with people often. When many people get infected, that is when pandemics happen. So it is important to maintain social distance and stay away from outside. </p>
