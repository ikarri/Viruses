	<h1><u>How Can We Be Safe?</u></h1>
	<p>How can WE be SAFE? The ways we can protect ourselves is to wear masks and gloves or stay home and be safe. CDC is telling us to do this for our own good and they are protecting us. Wearing a mask and gloves will help us from staying away from the germs. The best way of staying away from those germs is to stay home. You should be social distancing for about 6ft from one and another. The reason is if you are talking to someone and if they accidently spit, those germs can come on you so that is way it is safe to social distance. It is better to not have close contact with people and it is important for us to stay safe. The less cases and deaths the better! STAY HOME AND BE SAFE!</p>
